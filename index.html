    <p>With 9 years of experience in business operations, payroll, bookkeeping, and IT support, I am a highly organized individual who can problem solve and streamline business processes to increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace. My ability to learn quickly and work independently allowed me to gain experience in several areas of business operations and IT management. I am continuously learning to build my scope of knowledge and to excel at my work. Most recently, I have been developing my skills in process automation through scripting.</p>
