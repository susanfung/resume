    <h2>Learning and Development</h2>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Currently developing a scheduling and time-tracking web application
          using React in my current position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently learning the MERN stack and Django with 2 other software
          developers.
        </li>
        <li>
          First project using React was an Inventory Management System. This was
          a re-make of the Inventory Management System using R and Shiny. Both
          of these were passion projects that I created as a hobby. Codes can be
          found at <a href="https://gitlab.com/susanfung">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created calculation spreadsheets using Excel VBA to automatically
          calculate overtime and annual earnings for 400+ hourly employees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payroll automation through the use of R, resulting in a 50% decrease
          in processing time. The process involved extracting the data from one
          environment and completing the necessary manipulations and
          calculations in R, prior to uploading the revised data into the second
          environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed and enhanced company procedures manual, resulting in
          increased staff productivity. This involved identifying the need for
          automation via coding and / or the use / integration of new and
          existing software and technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed and managed IT infrastructure, and provided IT support to
          identify, troubleshoot, and resolve hardware and software technology
          problems.
        </li>
      </ul>
